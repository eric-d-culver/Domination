# Domination
These are Sage files used for finding reducible configurations for the domination number of cubic and subcubic planar graphs. It contains the following three files:
* domination.sage - used for testing reducible configurations for cubic planar graphs
* domination_weighted.sage - used for testing reducible configurations for subcubic planar graphs, where 3-vertices, 2-vertices, 1-vertices, and 0-vertices are weighted differently
* dom_inequal.sage - used to find appropriate weights from a set of reducible configurations
